# SFW
The SFW - "Simple Framwork" or "Safe for Work Framework", you choose - is a web framework, small enough to self-audit (i.e. read the source yourself).

This repo is just a placeholder for now. Current (research and) development will take place in the prototype repo [sfw-prototype](https://github.com/0scarB/sfw-prototype).
